# React Project README

This is a React project for a simple anime database. Follow the instructions below to get started:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal window and `cd` into the `animedb` directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install the client-side dependencies.
4. Run `npm run start` to start the client-side React app.
5. Open a new terminal window and `cd` into the `api` directory.
6. Run `npm install` to install the server-side dependencies.
7. Run `npm run start` to start the server-side API.
8. The React app should now be running on `http://localhost:3000/`, while the server-side API should be running on `http://localhost:8800/`.

Note: You may need to update the API URL in the React app to point to your local server instead of the deployed server, depending on your setup.
