# AniLog Project README

# This is a React project for a simple anime database. Follow the instructions below to get started:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal window and `cd` into the `animedb` directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install the client-side dependencies.
4. Run `npm run start` to start the client-side React app.
5. Open a new terminal window and `cd` into the `api` directory.
6. Run `npm install` to install the server-side dependencies.
7. Run `npm run start` to start the server-side API.
8. The React app should now be running on `http://localhost:3000/`, while the server-side API should be running on `http://localhost:8800/`.

# Code structure

1. Data exploration and cleaning files are in the current directory in the two `ipynb` files.
2. Client-side code is inside the `animedb` directory.
3. Server-side code is under the `api` directory.
4. Routes for API can be found in `index.js` and following each import in the corresponding `js` files under routes and controller folder. 
5. Specific queries for each route are defined in `js` files under the controller folder.

Note: the API URLs in the React app currently point to local server instead of the deployed server```
